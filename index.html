        <p>Aim:</p>
        <p>First player to get three counters to the opposite 'Home' side wins.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Instructions:</p>
        <p>For each turn, players can move their counters 3 times. Moves can be split amongst any of their counters in play in whichever way they like: one counter 3 times, or 3 different counters each once.</p>
        <p>Counters can move forward, or sideways if an adjacent square has a symbol matching their current square. Counters cannot move backwards.</p>
        <p>If a player encounters a counter of the opposite team, they are blocked (no one can move forward).</p>
        <p>Within the 'Free' lane, a player can move their counter to any unoccupied square.</p>
        <p>Players can only land on the 'Home' square if it is unoccupied by the other player.</p>
